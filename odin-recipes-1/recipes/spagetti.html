            <li>500g lean ground beef mince</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves, miced or crushed</li>
            <li>1 can or 800g of diced or chopped tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 tbsp tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 tsp dried organo or italian mixed herbs</li>
            <li>125ml beef stock<em> (Optional)</em></li>
            <li>1-2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>Salt and Black pepper<em> (to taste)</em></li>
            <li>300-400g dried spagetti</li>
            <li>Freshly grated Parmesan cheese for serving</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare water for pasta:</strong> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil for the spaghetti.</li>
            <li><strong>Saute aromatics:</strong> While the water heats, warm the olive oil in a large, wide skillet or pot over 
                medium-high heat. Add the finely chopped onion and cook for 3-5 minutes until softened and translucent. 
                Add the minced garlic and cook for another 30 seconds to a minute until fragrant.</li>
            <li><strong>Brown the beef:</strong> Turn the heat up to high and add the ground beef. Cook, breaking it up into small pieces with a wooden spoon, until it is no longer pink and is well browned. Drain off any excess fat if needed.</li>
            <li><strong>Add liquid and seasonings:</strong> If using, pour in the red wine and bring to a simmer, cooking for about 1 minute until the alcohol smell is gone and the liquid has reduced slightly. Stir in the chopped tomatoes, tomato paste, dried herbs, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and pepper. Break up the tomatoes with your spoon.</li>
            <li><strong>Simmer the sauce and cook pasta simultaneously:</strong> Bring the sauce to a boil, then reduce the heat to a gentle simmer (uncovered) for 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook the spaghetti:</strong> During the last 10-12 minutes of the sauce simmering, add the spaghetti to the boiling salted water and cook according to package directions until al dente (firm to the bite).</li>
            <li><strong>Combine and serve:</strong> Before draining the pasta, reserve about a cup of the starchy pasta water. Drain the spaghetti and, if desired, add it directly to the sauce with a splash of reserved pasta water and toss to combine (this helps the sauce cling to the pasta).</li>
            <li><strong>Finish:</strong> Serve immediately in bowls, topped with a generous amount of freshly grated Parmesan cheese. </li>
        </ol>
